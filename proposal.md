Pandas: .head() to .tail()
==========================

PyData Seattle 2015

# Brief Description

Pandas is an extremely powerful library for data analysis. With that power comes
complexity. This tutorial will focus on the core features of pandas, which handle
most data munging tasks. The empahsis will be on practical applications, illustrating
solutions to common problems using real-world data.

# Detailed Abstract

he motivation of this tutorial mirrors that of pandas itself: practicality.
A brief discussion on the problems pandas tries to solve will help frame the rest of the tutorial.
We'll aim for an intuitive understanding of each new method and data structure. This
will help keep us from getting overwhelmed by the options available as we expand our
data munging toolkit. The start of the talk will focus on the core operations of

- Selecting and Indexing
- Reshaping and Tidy Data
- Summarization
- Grouped operations
- Merging and Joining

These operations can be combined into "pandastic" method chains that flow seamlessly from data IO
to analysis.

Time permitting we'll look at some of the more specialized areas of pandas including
Categoricals, time-series analysis, Hierarchical Indexes, chunked / out of core processing,
and data pipelines.

Learning to use a library the size of pandas is a huge commitment. What's more, your
goal is rarely achieved *just* with pandas. Rather, pandas gets you to the point where you can
*begin* your interesting analysis. Maybe you'd much rather take some code off StackOverflow, than read
through the tens of thousandas of lines in the pandas [documentation](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.16.0/). *That's completely understandable*.

# Additional Notes

I want to stress that I'm extremely flexible on the target experience level, and even the topics covered.
I've marked intermediate, but I can focus in on more beginner or advanced concepts, or take a broader view as needed.
I taught a second-year statistics course to for three years, which gave me an appreciation for trying to convey the nuances of a difficult topic.
As a maintainer and heavy user of pandas I'm pretty familiar with the library
(although I don't think anyone can claim to know every corner of it). So I can
go as deep into the internals and mind-bending one liners as there's demand for.
I also use numpy, matplotlib, statsmodels, scipy, and scikit-learn on a daily basis.

As a rough example of some of my work that could be similar *in style* to the tutorial, see my Practical Pandas series, parts [one](http://tomaugspurger.github.io/posts/pp01.html), [two](http://tomaugspurger.github.io/posts/pp02.html), and [three](http://tomaugspurger.github.io/posts/pp03.html).
